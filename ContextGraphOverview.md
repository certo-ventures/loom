Once you have decision records, the “why” becomes first-class data. Over time, these records naturally form a context graph: the entities the business already cares about (accounts, renewals, tickets, incidents, policies, approvers, agent runs) connected by decision events (the moments that matter) and “why” links. Companies can now audit and debug autonomy and turn exceptions into precedent instead of re-learning the same edge case in Slack every quarter.
The feedback loop is what makes this compound. Captured decision traces become searchable precedent. And every automated decision adds another trace to the graph.

Systems of agents startups have a structural advantage: they’re in the orchestration path.
When an agent triages an escalation, responds to an incident, or decides on a discount, it pulls context from multiple systems, evaluates rules, resolves conflicts, and acts. The orchestration layer sees the full picture: what inputs were gathered, what policies applied, what exceptions were granted, and why. Because it’s executing the workflow, it can capture that context at decision time – not after the fact via ETL, but in the moment, as a first-class record.
That’s the context graph, and that will be the single most valuable asset for companies in the era of AI.

Three paths for startups
Systems of agents startups will take different paths, each of which has its own tradeoffs.
Some will replace existing system of records from day one. A CRM or ERP rebuilt around agentic execution, with event-sourced state and policy capture native to the architecture. This is hard because incumbents are entrenched, but it becomes viable at transition moments.
Of the many startups going after the AI SDR category, Regie has chosen to build an AI-native sales engagement platform to replace legacy platforms like Outreach/Salesloft, which were designed for humans executing sequences across a fragmented toolchain. Regie is designed for a mixed team where the agent is a first-class actor: it can prospect, generate outreach, run follow-ups, handle routing, and escalate to humans.
Some will replace modules rather than entire systems. These startups target specific sub-workflows where exceptions and approvals concentrate, then become the system of record for those decisions while syncing final state back to the incumbent.
Maximor is doing this in finance: automating cash, close management, and core accounting workflows without ripping out the GL. The ERP remains the ledger, but Maximor becomes the source of truth where the reconciliation logic lives.
Some will create entirely new systems of record. These startups start as orchestration layers, but they persist what enterprises never systematically stored: the decision-making trace. Over time that replayable lineage becomes the authoritative artifact. The agent layer stops being “just automation” and becomes the place the business goes to answer “why did we do that?”
PlayerZero exemplifies this pattern. Production engineering sits at the intersection of SRE, support, QA, and dev: a classic “glue function” where humans carry context that software doesn’t capture. PlayerZero starts by automating L2/L3 support, but the real asset is the context graph it builds: a living model of how code, config, infrastructure, and customer behavior interact in reality. That graph becomes the source of truth for “why did this break?” and “will this change break production?”: questions no existing system can answer.
As startups pursue these paths, observability for agents will become critical infrastructure. As decision traces accumulate and context graphs grow, enterprises will need to monitor, debug, and evaluate agent behavior at scale.
Arize is building the observability layer for this new stack – giving teams visibility into how agents reason, where they fail, and how their decisions perform over time. Just as Datadog became essential infrastructure for monitoring applications, Arize is positioned to become essential infrastructure for monitoring and improving agent decision quality.
